# CleanSwift
This application is written using "Clean Swift" architecture.

I tried to use modern methods, design patterns and best-practices when developing the app. 

I think of this a serious project that will be maintained for years, and design architecture accordingly; especially I think about maintainability, extendibility, understandability and performance.
